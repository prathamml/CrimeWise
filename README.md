CrimeWise ‚Äì Scalable Crime Categorization Using PySpark & ML

üîç Overview
CrimeWise is a scalable machine learning pipeline for automated classification of crime descriptions into predefined categories. Designed using PySpark for handling large-scale data, the system aims to support law enforcement by improving response accuracy and resource allocation through predictive crime categorization.
This project achieves 99.53% classification accuracy using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes, and integrates performance metrics visualization via Power BI for effective insights.

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Pipeline
The implementation follows a structured approach‚Äîfrom data ingestion to result visualization:

üìÅ Step 1: Data Extraction
Load crime dataset from Kaggle.
Extract key columns:
Category (target label)
Descript (crime description)

üßπ Step 2: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Text Tokenization: Using RegexTokenizer to tokenize crime descriptions.
Stopword Removal: Using StopWordsRemover to eliminate common words.
Vectorization:
CountVectorizer for bag-of-words representation
TF-IDF for term frequency weighting
Word2Vec for word embeddings
Label Encoding: Convert string labels into numeric form using StringIndexer.

üß† Step 3: Model Training & Evaluation
Trained five different model combinations:
Model Type	Feature Representation
Logistic Regression	CountVectorizer
Logistic Regression	TF-IDF
Logistic Regression	Word2Vec
Naive Bayes	CountVectorizer
Naive Bayes	TF-IDF

Metrics Evaluated:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

üìä Step 4: Result Interpretation & Visualization
Best result: TF-IDF + Naive Bayes with 99.53% accuracy.
Performance metrics visualized using Power BI dashboard.
Compared model trade-offs and practical implications for large-scale deployment.
